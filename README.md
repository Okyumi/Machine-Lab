# Machine Lab 

This repository is my course logbook and code archive for:

- **Course Code and Number:** IM-UH 2113  
- **Course Title:** Machine Lab  

Everything here supports the class workflow: documentations, iteration notes, and the code that drives them.

## Quick start (Arduino)

1. Install **Arduino IDE**.
2. Open a sketch from `arduino/` or a specific `projects/<name>/code/`.
3. Select the correct board and port.
4. Upload → test → iterate → log results.
