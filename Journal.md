- **Additional notes:**

  - For soldering, we need three hands, but as human beings we only have two. That’s why we use a third hand tool (a stand that holds the wire in place). Adjust the helping hands so you can solder comfortably.
  - Wires are usually made of copper. Stranded wire is better for long term use, and solid wire is better for short term use.
  - To strip a wire, clamp at the right gauge (which match the diameter of the wire), then squeeze and pull to remove the insulation.
  - Do not inhale the white smoke/ hold your breath.
  - Do not jab the tip into the brass cleaner aggressively.
  - An actuator is the opposite of a sensor.
  - A DC motor uses voltage or PWM to control speed and torque, while a servo motor is a motor plus a gearbox, a sensor (usually a potentiometer or encoder), and control electronics in one package. Servos are good at precise positioning and holding a position against a load.
  - The black part of the iron tip is oxidized; use the shiny part for soldering.

### Jan 22 Practice

- Practice soldering some wires and some header pins to a circuit board from
  the "practice" bin. Bring the board to class and show us your five best
  wires and five best pins.

**Notes taken:**
- Soldering iron, wonderful tool to bond metals at molecular level.
- do it quick, less than 2s, so that it doesn't damage any other components
- flux removes the oxidation, leaving the surface clean and ready to fuse to the solder alloy
- lead-based is easier than lead-free, but lead-free is more common nowadays.
- We solder with solder XD!
- As you solder, your tip will tend to oxidize, which means it will turn black and not want to accept solder.
- Brass sponges pull the excess solder from your tip while allowing the tip to maintain its current heat level.
- a rule of thumb of debugging (which by the way i highly agree): make it works first, then make it clean, then make it fast. Do no change more than one variables during the debugging. Do tests all the time.
- multimeter was first made in 1820s.
- Continuity: whether two points are elecrically connected to one another -> great to check solder bridges
- Resistance: keep increasing the range setting until the meter displays multiple digits appear. (you can also use smart tweezer rather than multimeter)
- Voltage: you can also use probe meter.
